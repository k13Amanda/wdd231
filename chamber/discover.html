                <p>Explore one of Florida’s oldest and largest state parks, filled with wetlands, swamps, and unique wildlife. An excellent destination for nature lovers.</p>
                <p>One of the state’s largest and oldest parks is ready to be discovered on the north side of the city.
        
                    Myakka River State Park has a wealth of natural environments like wetlands, marshes, and cypress swamps. One feature you have to track down is the Deep Hole, a karst sinkhole up to 100 feet deep.
        
                    With campgrounds and an acclaimed trail system, the park is a hotspot for amateur bird enthusiasts, who come to catch a glimpse of some of the seldom seen species that call the area home.
        
                    One of these is the roseate spoonbill, and I had the privilege of seeing this magnificent and reclusive species foraging on the muddy banks of the river.
        
                    The park opened in 1942, following almost a decade of work by the Civilian Conservation Corps, leaving it with beautiful parkitecture still in use today.</p>

                <p>Visit CoolToday Park to catch a baseball game or enjoy other exciting events. Home to the Atlanta Braves’ spring training, it’s an iconic venue in North Port.</p>
                <p>In 2019 North Port became the new spring training home for Major League Baseball’s Atlanta Braves.
        
                    The crowning glory of this $140 million complex is the CoolToday Park, seating 8,000 people.
        
                    I’ve watched a game here, and the best feature for me was the concourse walkway, which runs along the entire grandstand, and is something I normally associate with larger stadiums.
        
                    It means you can hang out a little, and chat with a few friends without missing any of the action.
        
                    During these warm-up games, taking place late February to late March, you’ll see some of baseball’s biggest names in action, and will get a glimpse of the next generation of stars.
        
                    Later in the year, CoolToday Park is the venue for North Port’s Freedom Festival, with live music and fireworks on July 4.</p>

                <p>If you want to spend more time in the wilderness around North Port then look no further than Deer Prairie Creek Preserve.
        
                    Almost 6,500 acres, this property encompasses a tributary of the Myakka River, and can be accessed from the edge of town at 10201 South Tamiami Trail (southern entrance).
        
                    For solitude, the Deer Prairie Creek Preserve is up there with the Myakka River State Park, with more than 60 miles of primitive, natural surface trails.
        
                    The preserve’s habitats range from wetlands to Florida dry prairie, oak hammock and scrubby flatwoods. There’s a diversity of wildlife to match, including bobcats, river otters and deer.
        
                    One species to look out for is the Florida scrub jay, which has been native to the region for more than two million years, but is now listed as ‘vulnerable’.</p>
